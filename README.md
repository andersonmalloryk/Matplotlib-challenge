# Matplotlib-challenge

This is the fifth homework for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp.

This project analyzes data from an animal study where 249 mice have a tumor treated through a variety of drug regiments and over the course of 45 days data was collected on the progress. The project is to generate the tables and figures needed for the tehnical report documenting the study.

Findings from the data analysis: Overall Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest average and median tumor growths for all of the drug regimines. Capomulin reduce tumor volume for the random mouse selected to be graphed, but overall on average the larger the mouse the larger the tumors it had with the Capomulin treatment. 

Duplicate data was removed. A summary table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimine was completed. Then a bar plot was generated showing the total number of measurements taken for each treatment resigmen throughout the study.
A pie plot is generated to show the distribtuion of female or male mice in the study. 
The final tumor volume for each mouse across the four treatment regimines was completed including the quartiles and IQR to quantitatively identify outliers. 
A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treaments was generated - outliers were highlighted within the plot.
To demonstrate the effect of Capomulin a line plot of tumor volume versus time point was generated for one mouse.
A scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight was generated for only the Capomulin treatment.
Correlation coefficient and linner regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment was completeed and a chart with both scatter plot and the liner regression line.
